From the user home (/users/USERNAME):

mkdir OpenPDACconda
module load LUMI
module load lumi-container-wrapper
conda-containerize new --prefix OpenPDACconda environment.yml

To use the Anaconda environment:

export PATH="/users/USERNAME/OpenPDACconda/bin:$PATH"

This path has to be changed also in the files Allrun.pre-1 and Allrun.post-1 

Copy the .sif file in a folder and edit its path in Allrun.post-2

To execute a OpenPDAC simulation:

1) sbatch ncores-pre-1.sh to execute blockMesh and decomposePar (all serial)

2) sbatch ncores-pre-2.sh to execute topoSet topoGrid and atmospheric initialisation (all parallel)

3) sbatch ncores-run.sh to execute the run (parallel)

4) sbatch ncores-post-1.sh to execute plotBallistics.py (serial) and createMaps.py (parallel)

5) sbatch ncores-post-2.sh to execute plotIso.py (parallel)
